### What is You Are Free?
#### It is a repository that makes available the solution of a problem or software, in several programming languages.
#### Aims to study the resources of the chosen language and to know which one provides better performance, readability, speed for the same problem. Analyzing possible difficulties in the development process, as well as access to the community, supporting companies in choosing the technology that meets their demand and reduces implementation, time, and development costs.

#### Where each FreeDev has their free space to develop their solution, including a.readme file that contains the resources used to solve the problem such as Frameworks, Libraries, APIS, and Databases, as well as bugs and application runtime in the free space with the name of the chosen language or technology.
